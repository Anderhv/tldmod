; dlga_lord_capture_troll_completed_two_trolls_thankyou_raise:lord_pretalk|You dare ask for an fully armoured battle troll, {playername}, to keep under your command? That's not a small thing to ask for. But you are a skilled servant, and we know your motivations. We like that. It shall be granted.

; dlga_lord_start:lord_follow_spy_half_completed|Blast and damn you! I wanted TWO prisoners, {playername} -- what you've brought me is one step short of useless! I already know everything the spy knows, it was the handler I was after. Here, half a job gets you half a reward. Take it and begone.
; dlga_lord_start:lord_follow_spy_half_completed.1|I asked you for two prisoners, {playername}, not one. Two. Still, I suppose you did capture the spy's handler, the more important one of the pair. The spy will not dare return here and will prove quite useless to whatever master he served. 'Tis better than nothing. However, you'll understand if I pay you half the promised reward for what is but half a success.
; dlga_lord_start:lord_follow_spy_failed|Truly, {playername}, you are nothing short of totally incompetent. Failing to capture both the spy AND his handler plumbs astonishing new depths of failure. Forget any reward I offered you. You've done nothing to earn it.
; dlga_lord_follow_spy_half_completed:lord_pretalk|I did my best, {s65}.

; dlga_lord_follow_spy_failed:lord_pretalk|Hrm. As you like, {s65}.
; dlga_lord_start:lord_generic_mission_completed.5|Damn me, but you've done it, {playername}. All the slaves are back and they're busy preparing for the harvest. You certainly earned your reward. Here, take it, with my compliments.
; dlga_lord_start:lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed|{playername}. I have been waiting patiently for my slaves, yet none have returned. Have you an explanation? Were you outwitted by simple animals, or are you merely incompetent?
; dlga_lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed:lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed_1a|Forgive me, {s65}, those slaves were slippery as eels.
; dlga_lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed_1a:lord_pretalk|Hmph, that is hardly an excuse for failure, {playername}. Now if you will excuse me, I need to capture new men to work these fields before we all starve.
; dlga_lord_start:lord_runaway_serf_half_completed|You disappoint me, {playername}. There were 3 groups of slaves that I charged you to return. 3. Not {reg17}. I suppose the ones who did come back shall have to work twice as hard to make up for those that got away. As for your reward, {playername}, I'll only pay you for the slaves you returned, not the ones you let fly. Here. Take it, and let this business be done.
; dlga_lord_runaway_serf_half_completed:lord_pretalk|Thank you, {s65}. You are indeed generous.

; dlga_lord_talk:tell_dorwinion_sack|My lord, I found a sack with a fading emblem of grapes and some shards of wood and metal inside that could have belong to a spear.
; dlga_tell_dorwinion_sack:tell_dorwinion_sack_2|Very interesting. This ancient sack could have born the mark of the finest wines that could only come from Dorwinion.
; dlga_tell_dorwinion_sack_2:tell_dorwinion_sack_3|I also found this Rhun helm in the sack. Could this tell us more about what happened to the Spears?
; dlga_tell_dorwinion_sack_3:lord_pretalk|Caravans are often robbed along the way. That helm is from a Rhun Scout. Follow the river down south to the Sea of Rhun and search the trade routes to Dorwinion and you may find what you are looking for.

; dlga_ring_hunters_start:ring_hunters_check|{playername}, I have heard of your exploits and you have made a name for yourself. I have a task specifically for such as yourself. You can deal with it however you wish.  Bloodshed cannot be avoided, especially against this group I am about to send you of to. Do you have sufficient men?
; dlga_ring_hunters_check:ring_hunters_1|Yes, my lord. I have a group of well-trained, battlehardened men. We are ready for anything.
; dlga_ring_hunters_check:ring_hunters_check_failed|I am afraid not, my lord.
; dlga_ring_hunters_check_failed:lord_pretalk|Then you are not ready for this task yet, {playername}. Go and gather more troops.
; dlga_ring_hunters_1:ring_hunters_2|Excellent. The North has recently been plagued by a marauding band of outlaws, who raid villages and ambush travellers searching for rings of any kind   You are to hunt these bandits down and put an end to their quest. Survivors of their last pillaging have reported two groups.   One with their loot moving towards Mirkwood Forest. The other, a considerable size, towards Beorn's House, perhaps to continue their destructive search.
; dlga_ring_hunters_2:ring_hunters_what|My lord, what could they be searching for?
; dlga_ring_hunters_2:ring_hunters_accept|My lord, I will do what is necessary to stop these... 'Ring Hunters'

; dlga_ring_hunters_accept:close_window|You are brave, General. We will await news of your success
; dlga_ring_hunters_reject:lord_pretalk|I see. Let me know when you are, but make haste, we do not want them to succeed.
; dlga_ring_hunters_what:ring_hunters_2|It is hard to know exactly what they want with this, but we can see that they are going through great lengths to find what they are looking for.   All we can surmise is that this must be a powerful weapon of sorts, a weapon to be used to cause more destruction under the Dark Lord's name.
; dlga_ring_hunters_what:ring_hunters_2.1|The Dark Lord previously sent emissaries to different dwarven clans, asking about the rings of power given to our people. These bandits may be looking for these..   Whether true or not, these must not fall into the Dark Lord's hands.
; dlga_lord_talk:ring_hunter_party_defeated|My lord, I come bearing ill news.. Though I have defeated the Ring Hunters terrorizing the villages, their leaders were not there. They may have found what they were looking for
; dlga_ring_hunter_party_defeated:ring_hunter_party_defeated2|This is not ill news, {playername}. We have heard of your great victory! The lives of those villagers matter more to our cause than any weapon. As we speak, the Beornings are amassing their strength, invigorated by your victory.     Moreover, we don't believe that these Ring Hunters found what they are looking for. If it was the weapon we feared, then we would have felt something.. a disturbance.
; dlga_ring_hunter_party_defeated2:ring_hunter_quest_end|I am glad, then. Whatever this weapon may have been... they may still be looking for it. I will remain vigilant and remain on the lookout for more of these Ring Hunters.
; dlga_ring_hunter_quest_end:close_window|We all will. Thank you once more for your service, {playername}.
; dlga_lord_talk:ring_hunter_lair_defeated_elf|My lord, though I was unable to intercept the Ring Hunters terrorizing the villages, I was able defeat their leaders in their lair. I also came across this
; dlga_ring_hunter_lair_defeated_elf:ring_hunter_lair_defeated|This is a minor ring of power.
; dlga_ring_hunter_lair_defeated:ring_hunter_lair_defeated2|Then we have prevented the Dark Lord from obtaining this, which he will undoubtly use to end more lives.
; dlga_ring_hunter_lair_defeated2:ring_hunter_lair_quest_end|You must keep this ring and use against the Dark Lord's forces. We know you will use it well.
; dlga_ring_hunter_lair_quest_end:close_window|This is a tremendous honour, my Lord. Thank you. I shall continue the battle against the Dark lord, and this will help tremendously.
; dlga_start:ring_hunters_party_attack|Look here, men. Another group to slaughter.
; dlga_ring_hunters_party_attack:ring_hunters_party_attack_2|Your rampaging has come to an end.
; dlga_ring_hunters_party_attack_2:close_window|Everyone, make sure you search their packs and their fingers. Save one to torture. Everything else you can eat.

; dlga_start:beorn_message|General, we received a message from {s1} that a large bandit party was headed our way! We had no time to gather enough forces, and when we heard the sound of battle, we prepared for the worse!
; dlga_beorn_message:beorn_message2|That was no ordinary bandit party. They were a collection of the Dark Lord's best...however, their leaders were not here...They have a lair near Mirkwood Forest and I must make haste.
; dlga_beorn_message2:beorn_message_end|Yes, the message mentioned the lair and we sent scouts towards it. We saw them burn it down and leave towards Mordor...If you went there first, you may not have been able to help us. We are truly grateful for your victory
; dlga_beorn_message_end:beorn_message_close|Then I must report back and tell {s1} what has transpired here. Go back to your village and prepare scouts. There may be stragglers.

; dlga_lord_mission_sorcerer_completed:lord_pretalk|Yes {playername}, I had sensed his death. The veil of sorcery has been lifted from the wood and much of my power has returned. You have performed a great service for our people and as such you are entitled to a gift. Take this...
; dlga_lord_mission_sorcerer_failed:lord_pretalk|Yes {playername}, I sense the dark arts of enemy still pressing upon us. His efforts seem greater now. It is unfortunate that you could not stop him.

; dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_1:lord_mission_capture_troll_2|How can I serve, Master?
; dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_2:lord_mission_capture_troll_3|A wild cave troll, {playername}. Capture one strong exemplar for me and bring it to me, alive. We need one more of them for Our experiments! Two, would be better. The more we have, the better.

; dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_3:lord_mission_capture_troll_rejected|Mercy, Master! That beast will smash me like a bug!
; dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_infoa:lord_mission_capture_troll_3|In these time of blood and shadows, wild cave trolls are growing excited and they are spreading from their lairs in the Misty Mountains... the best place where to look would be around the caves there.
; dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_infob:lord_mission_capture_troll_3|You shall find one, and take it down in combat. Fear not of killing it during the fight: a troll is too coriaceous a beast for your weapons to kill it right away... and they do recover, more than you would expect. After it falls over its own black blood, you shall carry it to our feet, still breathing.
; dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_infoc:lord_mission_capture_troll_3|You will be provided with a robust wheeled cage. It harbours more than enough space for a troll, and it can be pulled around. Hasten your steps on the way back: not even the metal of the cage is totally safe against the fury of a troll blinded by rage and pain. Make sure it does not break free and kill you.
; dlga_lord_mission_capture_troll_rejected:lord_pretalk|Only now you reveal what you are really worth, but I knew that of you all along. Weak, coward {playername}. Now begone.

; dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_tell_mission_kill_troll|Our land is facing dangers that were unheard of in our times. People are disappearing in the outskirts of {s3}.

; dlga_lord_tell_mission_kill_troll:lord_mission_told|Wild trolls, {playername}. Giant beasts, twisted montrousities. They never ventured so far from their dark caves in the mountains but at least one of them have been sighted around {s3}. I don't know what witchery has caused this, but I need that thing to be dispatched.
; dlga_lord_mission_told:lord_mission_kill_troll_info_a|How can those beasts be fought?
; dlga_lord_mission_kill_troll_info_a:lord_mission_told|A troll is a dangerous creature indeed. A giant monster which possesses an incredible strength in its deformed muscles. Their skin is as hard as iron, and a tree trunk is but a small club when wielded in their hands. It is rumored that a single troll can easily best a group of half a dozen well armed and trained men, wasting each of them with a single blow. Not only men but horses too fear trolls. Be careful if you plan to charge one while mounted.
; dlga_lord_mission_told:lord_mission_kill_troll_info_b|Do you think it comes from Mordor, or Isengard?
; dlga_lord_mission_kill_troll_info_b:lord_mission_told|No, I don't think so. We have news that both the White Wizard and the Black Tower have all kinds of monsters among their ranks, but from what I hear the beast terrifying {s3} is one savage, untamed beast. Remember, there could be more than one. But you can be sure that some obscure craft from the Enemy has led this new plague upon us.
; dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_0|Here is a mission for a trusted and brave servant like you, {playername}. The strangest rumors reach my ears from the forest of Fangorn. Minions sent to harvest wood, and even my commanders traversing the place, occasionally fail to return. Other times, they report of mysterious losses among their troops. They blame ghosts, spirits of the wood, ancient curses... Nonsense! Puny excuses for their own cowardice or ineptitude!
; dlga_lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_0:lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_1|What do you command me to do about it, Master?
; dlga_lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_0:lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_rejected|But Master, there is danger and pain in Fangorn! I've felt it myself!
; dlga_lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_1:lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_2|Maybe it is just that my other servants are unable to prevent the most cowardly worms in their troops from deserting.  Fools, blinded by superstitions.   Or, maybe, it is the treacherous ambushes of elven scum, hiding in the putrid trees as they usually do.   It could even be lowborn traitors from Rohan.  Or who knows what else. I want you to find out, {playername}.
; dlga_lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_2:lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_accepted|I fear no elves or spirit. Leave this to me, Master.
; dlga_lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_2:lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_rejected|Master, pity your servant! Don't ask me to venture in that cursed place!
; dlga_lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_rejected:lord_pretalk|So you are like the other worms: a superstitious, worthless coward.  I overestimated you. Now, begone!
; dlga_lord_mission_investigate_fangorn_accepted:lord_pretalk|Good. Go there and shed some light on this matter. Then return to me and report. I expect to see you back with news before {reg1} dawns are passed.
; dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_find_lost_spears|Here is a mission for a trusted and brave commander like you, {playername}. We are ill equipped to fight off the Rhun hordes. Our armies are losing battles one by one.

; dlga_lord_mission_find_lost_spears:lord_mission_find_lost_spears_1|What do you command me to do about it, my lord?
; dlga_lord_mission_find_lost_spears_1:lord_mission_find_lost_spears_2|These weapons would increase the effectiveness of our armies, but above all they will lift the spirits of our men. You'll have to find these spears. You'll have to go ask the dwarves for permission to search for the spears in the deeps of the Lonely Mountain. Beware, you may encounter some orcs or trolls in the tunnels. Are you available for this task?

; dlga_lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer:lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer_0|My power to defend and preserve Lothlorien has been diminished by the devices of the enemy. A master sorcerer of Dol Guldur is invoking powerful charms that inhibit our defenses. Though he is a mortal, he has become one of the enemies greatest pupils in the use of arcane rituals and he represents a great threat to our people. You must hunt him down and destroy him!
; dlga_lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer_0:lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer_1|Where can I find the sorcerer, my Lady?
; dlga_lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer_1:lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer_2|Search for him in Mirkwood forest, not far from Dol Guldur itself. He is both a well guarded and a cautious foe so you will need to use stealth to prevent the alarm from being raised. If he escapes, he will relocate to other dark places that we know not of and continue his wickedness unchallenged. There will be only one opportunity to defeat him. Much depends on your success. Go with our blessings.
; dlga_lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer_2:lord_pretalk|As you command, my Lady. I will try my best to eliminate this evil.
; dlga_lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer_2:lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer_rejected|Forgive me, my Lady. I have some pressing matters to attend before I can help your people with this endevour.
; dlga_lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer_rejected:lord_pretalk|I understand, {playername}. But do not tally for too long, I'm growing tired of resisting his evil magic.

; dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_deliver_message.1|I need to deliver a letter to {s13} of {s15}, who must be at {s4} currently. If you are going towards there, would you deliver my letter to him? The letter needs to reach him in 40 days.
; dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told|There is an urgent matter... My messenger is due to report on our battle plans to commanders in {s14}. His trip has been postponed several times already with all the trouble on the roads, but this time he must get through. So, I want to at least make sure he's well-guarded. I trust you well, {playername} so I would be very grateful if you could escort him to {s14} and make sure he arrives safe and sound.
; dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told.1|I have a friend here, an old warrior, who is very sick. Pestilence has infected an old battle wound,and unless he is seen to by a surgeon soon, he will surely die.

From what I've been hearing, they're running to {s3} as fast as they can, and have split up into three groups to try and avoid capture. I want you to capture all three groups and fetch them back to {s4} by whatever means necessary. I should really have them hanged for attempting to escape, but we need hands now, so I'll let them go off this time with a good beating.
; dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_tell_mission_follow_spy|I have good information that a man in this very town is actually an enemy spy. He should be seized and hanged for his impudence, but we also believe that very soon he will leave town to meet with his master, the man to whom the spy feeds all his little whispers.

; dlga_lord_tell_mission_follow_spy:lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_2|I want you to wait here until the spy leaves town. Then you must follow him, stealthily, to the meeting place.

; dlga_trainer_talk:trainer_combat_begin|First, tell me something about combat...
; dlga_trainer_talk:trainer_choose_mode|I'm ready for training.
; dlga_trainer_talk:close_window|I need to leave now. Farewell.
; dlga_trainer_combat_begin:trainer_talk_combat|What do you want to know?
; dlga_trainer_combat_pretalk:trainer_talk_combat|What else do you want to know?
; dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_explain_defense|Tell me about defending myself.
; dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_explain_attack|Tell me about attacking with weapons.
; dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_explain_horseback|Tell me about fighting on horseback.
; dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_pretalk|I guess I know all the theory I need. Let's talk about something else.
; dlga_trainer_explain_defense:trainer_explain_defense_2|Good question. The first thing you should know as a fighter is how to defend yourself. Keeping yourself out of harm's way is the first rule of combat, and it is much more important than giving harm to others. Everybody can swing a sword around and hope to cut some flesh, but only those fighters that are experts at defense live to tell of it.
; dlga_trainer_explain_defense_2:trainer_explain_defense_3|Now. Defending yourself is easiest if you are equipped with a shield. Just block with your shield. [Hold down the right mouse button to defend yourself with the shield.] In this state, you will be able to deflect all attacks that come from your front. However, you will still be open to strikes from your sides or your back.
; dlga_trainer_explain_defense_3:trainer_explain_defense_4|What if I don't have shield?
; dlga_trainer_explain_defense_4:trainer_combat_pretalk|Then you will have to use your weapon to block your opponent. This is a bit more difficult than defending with a shield. Defending with a weapon, you can block against only ONE attack direction. That is, you block against either overhead swings, side swings or thrusts. Therefore you must watch your opponent carefully and start to block AFTER he starts his attack. In this way you will be able to block against the direction of his current attack. If you start to block BEFORE he makes his move, he may just attack in another direction than the one you are blocking against and score a hit.
; dlga_trainer_explain_attack:trainer_explain_attack_2|Good question. Attacking is the best defence, they say. A tactic many fighters find useful is taking an offensive stance and readying your weapon for attack, waiting for the right moment for swinging it. [You can ready your weapon for attack by pressing and holding down the left mouse button.]
; dlga_trainer_explain_attack_2:trainer_explain_attack_3|That sounds useful.
; dlga_trainer_explain_attack_3:trainer_explain_attack_4|It is a good tactic, but remember that, your opponent may see that and take a defensive stance against the direction you are swinging your weapon. If that happens, you must break your attack and quickly attack from another direction [You may cancel your current attack by quickly tapping the right mouse button].
; dlga_trainer_explain_attack_4:trainer_explain_attack_5|If my opponent is defending against the direction I am attacking from, I will break and use another direction.
; dlga_trainer_explain_attack_5:trainer_combat_pretalk|Yes, selecting the direction you swing your weapon is a crucial skill. There are four main directions you may use: right swing, left swing, overhead swing and thrust. You must use each one wisely. [to control your swing direction with default controls, move your mouse in the direction you want to swing from as you press the left mouse button].
; dlga_trainer_explain_horseback:trainer_combat_pretalk|Very good question. A horse may be a warrior's most powerful weapon in combat. It gives you speed, height, power and initiative. A lot of deadly weapons will become even deadlier on horseback. However you must pay particular attention to horse-mounted enemies couching their lances, as they may take down any opponent in one hit. [To use the couched lance yourself, wield a lance or similar weapon, and speed up your horse without pressing attack or defense buttons. after you reach a speed, you'll lower your lance. Then try to target your enemies by maneuvering your horse.]

Mines and roads are not safe anymore, and getting resupplied with raw materials is more and more difficult. The enemy must have its own obscure, but efficient ways of extracting ore, as we've seen even orcs and other lowly beasts in their ranks go around covered with metal. Its quality matches that of the wearers: it is low-grade, cheap iron; the kind we would consider treacherous and not trust in normal times. But in these times our smelters learnt how to deal with poor materials too, if necessary. Every little bit helps.
; dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.4|A task, you say? The Master demands more troops every day, and they are never battle-worthy enough for Him... but armours don't just grow on skins, you know?^The maggots in charge of bringing ore supplies are treacherous and weak, they get themselves slaughtered too easily and we are left without materials. But these men, these elves... they always go around covered with shiny, precious metals protecting them as if they were all kings, down to their lowest-born...^Scavenge their corpses and bring me the metal, {playername}. With a pound of that iron, our smelter can make enough material to cover an entire pack of warriors.
