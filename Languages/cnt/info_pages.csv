ip_formations_and_morale|陣型和士氣
; ip_formations_and_morale_text|Your troops will position themselves and hold at the beginning of each battle, instead of blindly charging. Only major factions (all 18 of them) use formations (+deserters), bandits will simply charge. There is a slight difference between good and evil factions, good infantry will form shield walls (usually defensive - shielded troops first, but it can form a phalanx if you have pikemen), while evil infantry will form ranks (best troops first). Formations only work in field battles (meaning not in custom battles and sieges).^^Any time in-game that you have a formation form or "Hold", it will set up near the position that the player had when the command was issued: infantry to the left, cavalry to the right, and archers up front. Additionally, the formations may maintain the same FACING that the player had (depending on mod design). Whenever a unit first forms a particular formation, troops may spread out for ease of forming up (depending on mod design). Player troops start every battle in formation. Unless changed by mod design, formation key bindings are: "J" for ranks, "K" for weapon-based ranks (shieldwall, phalanx),"L" for wedge (the player ought to reassign the "L" for "Log" mapping)";" for square, "U" for no formation (undo formation). The "ranks" command for archers puts them in a staggered line. Cavalry will not make any formation other than the wedge.^^Charge (and Dismount for cavalry) will undo a formation. The player may Advance multiple times to have a formation move toward the average position of the enemy. Or use the order panel or hold-F1 to place them (or sweep them across the enemy for the cavalry wedge). As a leader it's your responsibility to keep your troops in order during battle. The more casualties your side suffers, the more their morale crumbles. Keep watching for messages popping up! You can support your troops in two ways:^^1. Killing enemies. If you do well, you impress your men and they fight harder and don't flee.^^2. Rallying them. If your troops are fleeing, press "V". Your character will sound a horn and rally the troops. You get only a limited amount of rallies per battle! (the amount is based on your Charisma and Leadership)^^It can be quite the advantage if you manage to defeat the enemy commander, because that robs enemies of their leader, they cannot be rallied. Therefore once you manage to rout them, they're gone.
ip_economy|經濟
ip_economy_text|TLD里沒有金錢的概念。作為替代，你和陣營發展關係—那由資源、影響力和等級表示。^^資源對陣營而言是戰爭所必需—你可以用掠奪的廢料和物品兌換它，依據你在一個陣營中的等級，你也會每週得到一定數量的資源薪餉。你可以用這筆薪餉為你和你的同伴獲得士兵、裝備、馬匹，但前提是你積累得足夠多。你的每一個陣營都有一個獨立的資源/影響力/等級池，要牢記這一點！^影響力點數會在完成任務或贏得艱難的戰鬥后輩獎勵。它們可以隨後被用於特殊物品，作為你獲得影響力的陣營的統治者的獎賞。^^等級點數允許你提升在對應陣營中的等級—這將決定你的隊伍人數上限，每週的資源收入，和解鎖一些其餘的東西。^一定要忠於傳統，我們在默認選項里已經禁止了“變裝”：一個剛鐸人不太可能穿戴掠奪來的獸人盔甲，反之亦然。在大多數戰鬥后，你在戰利品中幾乎不會發現能直接使用的物品。作為替代，“金屬廢料”會掉落，它表示可回收使用的裝備，並且可以拿來給你的的有需要的鐵匠來換取資源點數。
ip_war_of_the_ring|魔戒之戰
; ip_war_of_the_ring_text|At the beginning of the game the War between good and evil hasn't started yet. You'll be notified when it does. (This does NOT depend on time spent playing, rather on how ready your character is for the war.) While Middle Earth might look like a pretty empty and quiet place at start, it gets filled with hostile parties very quickly once the War starts. Be prepared and use your few days of peace wisely! You can perform quests for the lords and leaders of all allied factions, raise troops and train yourself in the barracks.^^The war itself can be won or lost, unlike in the original M&B. Every faction has a strength rating - which changes according to faction successes or failures in battles. With strength dropping low enough, it becomes possible for enemies to siege faction cities/camps. When a faction drops to the lowest status, it is possible to defeat it completely by storming its capital.^^Note that player himself cannot initiate sieges in TLD. He can only help his faction and allies in siege battles if their leaders decide that it is time to go storm the enemy settlement.^^(This is a design decision, not a bug. It's also something we want to tweak in future releases, so the option to siege is available, but very costly and difficult to obtain)^^There are several theatres of war in TLD, defined by geography. When one side eliminates all the enemies in its current theatre, it will send an expeditionary force to help allies on other theatres. Expeditionary force will build an advance camp in the other theatre and operate from there. If the good forces are completely defeated, but Mordor and Isengard still stand strong, the two towers will battle each other over total dominance.
ip_starting_tips|啟動提示
ip_starting_tips_text|你可以在一開始選擇之後無法更改的陣營。你也可以選擇不同的種族：人類、精靈、矮人、獸人、半獸人。牢記你選擇的陣營和種族會在某些方面限制你。一些陣營提供少量精銳的士兵，一些則相反。較小的半獸人無法穿戴為大個頭設計的盔甲，卻能騎一些野獸。矮人有著傑出的盔甲，卻無法騎乘。^^這種設計不是為了完全（人為的）平衡。扮演弱小的種族或陣營會更有挑戰性（第一次玩時，你或許想要更好的選項，它們在開始菜單可選列表的頂部）。^^你選擇一個陣營，為之戰鬥，知道你的一方贏得了這場偉大的戰爭，或者你的陣營被抹除了。在後者的情況下，你仍然可以為盟軍戰鬥。^^—漫無目的地徘徊並不是一個好主意，這場戰爭需要你自己的目的和打算。在戰爭開始前，你該聚集起一班勇士，獲得低費用的部隊和一些財物來做好準備。在戰爭開始后，你的策略可以有很多。記住，削弱敵人和幫助盟友同樣重要。^—履行陣營領主的任務是一個提升等級、獲得資源和影響力點數的好辦法。^—同時接受多個任務/請求，向每個人詢問！你可以常常四處做任務，比如在送信的同時有幾個已完成的任務。不要浪費時間！
ip_rumours_and_legendary_places|謠言和傳說中的地方
; ip_rumours_and_legendary_places_text|Talking to people in settlements, you can read commentary from their faction's perspective. This will often contain interesting lore and sometimes even information unlocking special Legendary Locations on the world map.^^Some of these are only for exploration and don't serve any other purpose, some of them contain unique quests and easter eggs. When you unlock one, you'll be notified by a message.
ip_trolls|巨魔
; ip_trolls_text|Trolls are very powerful. Evil players can't simply recruit them, but there are other ways of obtaining a troll or two. They do not listen to orders, so keep your troops far away from their devastating attacks!^^If you're looking for trolls as a mission, they can be found roaming around settlements they've been harassing (although friendly parties sometimes drive them further away, or outright deal with them before you do), or they roam the Misty Mountains, mostly nearby to their home caves.
