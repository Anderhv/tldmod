; dlga_lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed_1a:lord_pretalk|Hmph, that is hardly an excuse for failure, {playername}. Now if you will excuse me, I need to capture new men to work these fields before we all starve.
; dlga_lord_start:lord_runaway_serf_half_completed|You disappoint me, {playername}. There were 3 groups of slaves that I charged you to return. 3. Not {reg17}. I suppose the ones who did come back shall have to work twice as hard to make up for those that got away. As for your reward, {playername}, I'll only pay you for the slaves you returned, not the ones you let fly. Here. Take it, and let this business be done.

dlga_lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer_0:lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer_1|我在哪里能找到法师,夫人?
; dlga_lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer_1:lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer_2|Search for him in Mirkwood forest, not far from Dol Guldur itself. He is both a well guarded and a cautious foe so you will need to use stealth to prevent the alarm from being raised. If he escapes, he will relocate to other dark places that we know not of and continue his wickedness unchallenged. There will be only one opportunity to defeat him. Much depends on your success. Go with our blessings.
; dlga_lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer_2:lord_pretalk|As you command, my Lady. I will try my best to eliminate this evil.
; dlga_lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer_2:lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer_rejected|Forgive me, my Lady. I have some pressing matters to attend before I can help your people with this endevour.
; dlga_lord_mission_mirkwood_sorcerer_rejected:lord_pretalk|I understand, {playername}. But do not tally for too long, I'm growing tired of resisting his evil magic.
; dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_deliver_message|I need to send a letter to {s13} who should be currently at {s4}. If you will be heading towards there, would you deliver it to him? The letter needs to be in his hands in 30 days.
; dlga_lord_mission_deliver_message:lord_mission_deliver_message_accepted|Certainly, I intend to pass by {s4} and it would be no trouble.
; dlga_lord_mission_deliver_message:lord_mission_deliver_message_rejected|I doubt I'll be seeing {s13} anytime soon, {s65}. You'd best send it with someone else.
; dlga_lord_mission_deliver_message_accepted:close_window|I appreciate it, {playername}. Here's the letter. Give my regards to {s13} when you see him.
; dlga_lord_mission_deliver_message_rejected:lord_pretalk|Ah, all right then. Well, I am sure I will find someone else.
; dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_deliver_message.1|I need to deliver a letter to {s13} of {s15}, who must be at {s4} currently. If you are going towards there, would you deliver my letter to him? The letter needs to reach him in 40 days.
; dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told|There is an urgent matter... My messenger is due to report on our battle plans to commanders in {s14}. His trip has been postponed several times already with all the trouble on the roads, but this time he must get through. So, I want to at least make sure he's well-guarded. I trust you well, {playername} so I would be very grateful if you could escort him to {s14} and make sure he arrives safe and sound.
; dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told.1|I have a friend here, an old warrior, who is very sick. Pestilence has infected an old battle wound,and unless he is seen to by a surgeon soon, he will surely die. This man is dear to me, {playername},but he's also stubborn as a hog and refuses to have anyone look at his injury because he doesn't trust the physicians here.I have heard that you've a capable surgeon with you. If you would let your surgeon come here and have a look,{reg3?she:he} may be able to convince him to give his consent to an operation.Please, I will be deeply indebted to you if you grant me this request.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_raise_troops:lord_tell_mission_raise_troops_2|你需要多少人?
dlga_lord_tell_mission_raise_troops_2:lord_mission_raise_troops_told|如果你能训练出{reg1} {s14} 带给我,那就够了.
dlga_lord_mission_raise_troops_told:lord_mission_raise_troops_accepted|当然, {s65}. 给我{reg1} 新兵,我会把他们训练成{s14}.
dlga_lord_mission_raise_troops_told:lord_mission_raise_troops_rejected|我这些天很忙没时间训练他们.
; dlga_lord_mission_raise_troops_accepted:close_window|You've taken a weight off my shoulders, {playername}. I shall tell my sergeants to send you the recruits and attach them to your command.

; dlga_lord_mission_raise_troops_rejected:lord_pretalk|Oh, of course. I had expected as much. Well, good luck to you then.
; dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_told|I have something you could help with, an issue with the lawless villain known as {s4}.  He murdered one of my bodyguards and has been on the run from his judgment ever since. There were news recently that the fugitive has been seen at {s3}. You might be able to hunt him down and deliver him swift justice, and I'll reward you in turn.
; dlga_lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_told:lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_accepted|Then I will hunt him down and execute the law.
; dlga_lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_told:lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_rejected|I am too busy to go after him at the moment.
; dlga_lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_accepted:close_window|That's excellent, {playername}.  I will be grateful, and of course your prowess wil be duly noted.  Well, good hunting to you.
; dlga_lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_rejected:lord_pretalk|As you wish, {playername}.I suppose there are plenty of bounty hunters around to get the job done . . .
; dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told.2|Well, some of the slaves working in {s4} have run away.  The ungrateful swine, whose lives we spared!  From what I've been hearing, they're running to {s3} as fast as they can, and have split up into three groups to try and avoid capture. I want you to capture all three groups and fetch them back to {s4} by whatever means necessary. I should really have them hanged for attempting to escape, but we need hands now, so I'll let them go off this time with a good beating.
; dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_tell_mission_follow_spy|I have good information that a man in this very town is actually an enemy spy. He should be seized and hanged for his impudence, but we also believe that very soon he will leave town to meet with his master, the man to whom the spy feeds all his little whispers. The spy himself is of little import, but the master is a dangerous man, and could tell us a great deal if we could only get our hands on him...
; dlga_lord_tell_mission_follow_spy:lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_2|I want you to wait here until the spy leaves town. Then you must follow him, stealthily, to the meeting place. You must take absolute care not to be seen by the spy on your way, else he may suspect foul play and turn back. When the master appears, you must ambush and arrest them and bring the pair back to me. Alive, if you please.
; dlga_lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_2:lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_accepted|I'll do it, {s65}.
; dlga_lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_2:lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_rejected|No, this skulking is not for me.
; dlga_lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_accepted:close_window|Good, I'm sure you'll do a fine job of it. One of my men will point the spy out to you when he leaves, so you will know the man to follow. Remember, I want them both, and I want them alive.
; dlga_lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_rejected:lord_pretalk|A shame. Well, carry on as you were, {playername}...
; dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero|There is a difficult job I need done, {playername}, and you may be the one who can carry it off. I need someone to capture one of the enemy commanders and bring him to me. Afterwards, I'll be able to question him on the enemy battle plans. It is a simple enough job, but whomever you choose will be guarded by an elite band of personal retainers. Are you up for a fight?
; dlga_lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero:lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero_accepted|Consider it done, {s65}.
; dlga_lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero:lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero_rejected|I must refuse, {s65}. I don't want to get close to any of them.
; dlga_lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero_accepted:close_window|I like your spirit! Go and bring me one of our enemies, and I'll toast your name in my hall when you return! And reward you for your efforts, of course...
; dlga_lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero_rejected:lord_pretalk|Clearly you lack the mettle I had thought you possessed. Very well, {playername}, I will find someone else.

; dlga_lord_tell_mission_lend_companion_rejected:lord_pretalk|Well, that's damned unfortunate, but I suppose I cannot force you or {s3} to agree. I shall have to make do without.
; dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told.3|Our scouts have noticed a recent increase in enemy activity. Unfortunately they almost never succeed in capturing live prisoners and bring them in for questioning, so we can piece together what the enemy is up to.

; dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_pretalk|No, {playername}. I do not need your help at this time.

; dlga_lord_mission_rejected:close_window|Is that so? Well, I suppose you're just not up to the task. I shall have to look for somebody with more mettle.

And the paint on their shields is an ancient Mordor sign. I haven't seen those this side of the river for a long time. Dire things are afoot.. War is coming! I advise you to go to Edoras, the capital of your people, and deliver the message about what you've seen to whomever is in command there. It's an important matter, so please make haste.

There is a small fort near Nindalf swamps, where common people and travellers can find food and lodge. It's run by a local chief who does not answer neither to Gondor, nor to Rohan. I'm a merchant traveller myself, so I have respect for people wishing to be free from lordship bonds, as long as they behave. But being independent, they are also powerless before enemy onslaught. War outbreak in next several days looks like a certain thing to me. I want you to get to those people and see if you can help them survive.

; dlga_trainer_explain_defense_2:trainer_explain_defense_3|Now. Defending yourself is easiest if you are equipped with a shield. Just block with your shield. [Hold down the right mouse button to defend yourself with the shield.] In this state, you will be able to deflect all attacks that come from your front. However, you will still be open to strikes from your sides or your back.
dlga_trainer_explain_defense_3:trainer_explain_defense_4|如果我没有盾牌呢？
; dlga_trainer_explain_defense_4:trainer_combat_pretalk|Then you will have to use your weapon to block your opponent. This is a bit more difficult than defending with a shield. Defending with a weapon, you can block against only ONE attack direction. That is, you block against either overhead swings, side swings or thrusts. Therefore you must watch your opponent carefully and start to block AFTER he starts his attack. In this way you will be able to block against the direction of his current attack. If you start to block BEFORE he makes his move, he may just attack in another direction than the one you are blocking against and score a hit.
; dlga_trainer_explain_attack:trainer_explain_attack_2|Good question. Attacking is the best defence, they say. A tactic many fighters find useful is taking an offensive stance and readying your weapon for attack, waiting for the right moment for swinging it. [You can ready your weapon for attack by pressing and holding down the left mouse button.]
dlga_trainer_explain_attack_2:trainer_explain_attack_3|听上去挺有用。
; dlga_trainer_explain_attack_3:trainer_explain_attack_4|It is a good tactic, but remember that, your opponent may see that and take a defensive stance against the direction you are swinging your weapon. If that happens, you must break your attack and quickly attack from another direction [You may cancel your current attack by quickly tapping the right mouse button].
; dlga_trainer_explain_attack_4:trainer_explain_attack_5|If my opponent is defending against the direction I am attacking from, I will break and use another direction.
; dlga_trainer_explain_attack_5:trainer_combat_pretalk|Yes, selecting the direction you swing your weapon is a crucial skill. There are four main directions you may use: right swing, left swing, overhead swing and thrust. You must use each one wisely. [to control your swing direction with default controls, move your mouse in the direction you want to swing from as you press the left mouse button].
; dlga_trainer_explain_horseback:trainer_combat_pretalk|Very good question. A horse may be a warrior's most powerful weapon in combat. It gives you speed, height, power and initiative. A lot of deadly weapons will become even deadlier on horseback. However you must pay particular attention to horse-mounted enemies couching their lances, as they may take down any opponent in one hit. [To use the couched lance yourself, wield a lance or similar weapon, and speed up your horse without pressing attack or defense buttons. after you reach a speed, you'll lower your lance. Then try to target your enemies by maneuvering your horse.]
; dlga_trainer_choose_mode:trainer_choose_mode_player|We have several training modes to improve our soldiers' skills. Single combat will pit you against one to four opponents, in team combat your team of four will face four, eight or twelve combatants, and, finally, Gauntlet is the ultimate challenge for any warrior - you'll face waves of increasing number of opponents all by yourself.

; dlga_merchant_quest_brief:merchant_quest_looters_choice|We've had some fighting near the {s5} lately, with all the chaos that comes with it, and that's attracted a few bands of tribal orcs to raid the surroundings during the confusion. I need somebody to teach those orcs a lesson. Sound like your kind of work?

; dlga_merchant_quest_looters_choice:merchant_quest_stall|I'm afraid you have to find someone else for that.

; dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.3|A task, you say? Actually I am looking for someone to supply us with ore and metals. Mines and roads are not safe anymore, and getting resupplied with raw materials is more and more difficult. The enemy must have its own obscure, but efficient ways of extracting ore, as we've seen even orcs and other lowly beasts in their ranks go around covered with metal. Its quality matches that of the wearers: it is low-grade, cheap iron; the kind we would consider treacherous and not trust in normal times. But in these times our smelters learnt how to deal with poor materials too, if necessary. Every little bit helps.
; dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.4|A task, you say? The Master demands more troops every day, and they are never battle-worthy enough for Him... but armours don't just grow on skins, you know?^The maggots in charge of bringing ore supplies are treacherous and weak, they get themselves slaughtered too easily and we are left without materials. But these men, these elves... they always go around covered with shiny, precious metals protecting them as if they were all kings, down to their lowest-born...^Scavenge their corpses and bring me the metal, {playername}.
