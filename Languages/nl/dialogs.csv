Je denkt dat ze bruin zijn, geschoten met groen licht, alsof er een dikke put achter ze staat, opgevuld met leeftijden van geheugen en lange, langzame en vaste gedachten. Maar aan de oppervlakte glinsteren zijn ogen met het heden... Zoals de zon glinstert op de buitenste bladeren van een enorme boom, of de rimpelingen van een erg diep meer.)

For one thing it would take a long while. My name is growing all the time and I've lived a very long, long time; so my name is like a story. Real names tell you the story of things they belong to in my language, in the Old Entish as you might say.

In het begin waren we haastiger en soepel. Met de tijd zijn velen van ons verloren geraakt. Sommigen onder ons zijn nog steeds ware Enten, en levendig genoeg op onze manier, maar velen worden slaperig, worden boom-ig, zou je kunnen zeggen. De meeste bomen zijn slechts bomen uiteraard; maar velen zijn half ontwaakt. Sommigen zijn bijna klaarwakker en enkelen zijn, wel, ah, ze worden Entig. Dat gebeurt altijd. Wanner dat met een boom gebeurt, ontdek je dat sommigen kwade harten hebben. Toch doen we wat we kunnen.

; dlga_lord_talk:ring_hunter_lair_defeated_elf|My lord, though I was unable to intercept the Ring Hunters terrorizing the villages, I was able to defeat their leaders in their lair. They had this in their possession.
; dlga_ring_hunter_lair_defeated_elf:ring_hunter_lair_defeated|I see, a ring, but not THE ring. Not even one of the great rings, yet not a mere trinket either. There is some power woven into it.

; dlga_start:trainer_talk|Good day. Ready for some training today?
; dlga_trainer_pretalk:trainer_talk|Are you ready for some training?
; dlga_trainer_talk:trainer_combat_begin|First, tell me something about combat...
dlga_trainer_talk:trainer_choose_mode|Ik ben klaar voor training.
dlga_trainer_talk:close_window|Ik moet nu vertrekken. Vaarwel.
dlga_trainer_combat_begin:trainer_talk_combat|Wat wil je weten?
dlga_trainer_combat_pretalk:trainer_talk_combat|Wat wil je nog meer weten?
dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_explain_defense|Vertel me over mezelf verdedigen.
dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_explain_attack|Vertel me over aanvallen met wapens.
dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_explain_horseback|Vertel me over vechten te paard.
; dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_pretalk|I guess I know all the theory I need. Let's talk about something else.
; dlga_trainer_explain_defense:trainer_explain_defense_2|Good question. The first thing you should know as a fighter is how to defend yourself. Keeping yourself out of harm's way is the first rule of combat, and it is much more important than giving harm to others. Everybody can swing a sword around and hope to cut some flesh, but only those fighters that are experts at defense live to tell of it.
; dlga_trainer_explain_defense_2:trainer_explain_defense_3|Now. Defending yourself is easiest if you are equipped with a shield. Just block with your shield. [Hold down the right mouse button to defend yourself with the shield.] In this state, you will be able to deflect all attacks that come from your front. However, you will still be open to strikes from your sides or your back.
; dlga_trainer_explain_defense_3:trainer_explain_defense_4|What if I don't have shield?
; dlga_trainer_explain_defense_4:trainer_combat_pretalk|Then you will have to use your weapon to block your opponent. This is a bit more difficult than defending with a shield. Defending with a weapon, you can block against only ONE attack direction. That is, you block against either overhead swings, side swings or thrusts. Therefore you must watch your opponent carefully and start to block AFTER he starts his attack. In this way you will be able to block against the direction of his current attack. If you start to block BEFORE he makes his move, he may just attack in another direction than the one you are blocking against and score a hit.
; dlga_trainer_explain_attack:trainer_explain_attack_2|Good question. Attacking is the best defence, they say. A tactic many fighters find useful is taking an offensive stance and readying your weapon for attack, waiting for the right moment for swinging it. [You can ready your weapon for attack by pressing and holding down the left mouse button.]
dlga_trainer_explain_attack_2:trainer_explain_attack_3|Dat klinkt nuttig om te weten.
; dlga_trainer_explain_attack_3:trainer_explain_attack_4|It is a good tactic, but remember that, your opponent may see that and take a defensive stance against the direction you are swinging your weapon. If that happens, you must break your attack and quickly attack from another direction [You may cancel your current attack by quickly tapping the right mouse button].
; dlga_trainer_explain_attack_4:trainer_explain_attack_5|If my opponent is defending against the direction I am attacking from, I will break and use another direction.
; dlga_trainer_explain_attack_5:trainer_combat_pretalk|Yes, selecting the direction you swing your weapon is a crucial skill. There are four main directions you may use: right swing, left swing, overhead swing and thrust. You must use each one wisely. [to control your swing direction with default controls, move your mouse in the direction you want to swing from as you press the left mouse button].
; dlga_trainer_explain_horseback:trainer_combat_pretalk|Very good question. A horse may be a warrior's most powerful weapon in combat. It gives you speed, height, power and initiative. A lot of deadly weapons will become even deadlier on horseback. However you must pay particular attention to horse-mounted enemies couching their lances, as they may take down any opponent in one hit. [To use the couched lance yourself, wield a lance or similar weapon, and speed up your horse without pressing attack or defense buttons. after you reach a speed, you'll lower your lance. Then try to target your enemies by maneuvering your horse.]
; dlga_trainer_choose_mode:trainer_choose_mode_player|We have several training modes to improve our soldiers' skills. Single combat will pit you against one to four opponents, in team combat your team of four will face four, eight or twelve combatants, and, finally, Gauntlet is the ultimate challenge for any warrior - you'll face waves of increasing number of opponents all by yourself. Mass melee is a simple brawl.^Which one do you prefer?
; dlga_trainer_choose_mode_player:trainer_choose_opponents|Single combat.
; dlga_trainer_choose_mode_player:trainer_choose_opponents.1|Team combat.

; dlga_trainer_choose_opponents_player:trainer_choose_weapon.6|Twelve, me and my companions can take on anyone.
; dlga_trainer_choose_opponents_player:trainer_pretalk|None, I've changed my mind.
; dlga_trainer_choose_weapon:trainer_choose_weapon_player|And finally choose your preferred weapon type.
; dlga_trainer_choose_weapon_player:trainer_begin_training|One-handed weapons.
; dlga_trainer_choose_weapon_player:trainer_begin_training.1|Two-handed weapons.

; dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.4|Thanks for offering to help.Actually I was looking for someone to supply us with Food.Perhaps you can do that...
; dlga_merchant_quest_brief:merchant_quest_brief_deliver_food|Our food supplies are dwindling and the supply trains are getting waylaid by the enemy.I need someone to bring us {reg5} units of food in {reg6} days, or we'll begin to starve.Maybe nearby friendly towns have enough for us too. What do you say?
; dlga_merchant_quest_brief_deliver_food:merchant_quest_taken|Alright. I will find the food and bring it to you.
; dlga_merchant_quest_brief_deliver_food:merchant_quest_stall|I am sorry, you'll need to find someone else for that.
; dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.5|A task, you say? Actually I am looking for someone to supply us with ore and metals. Mines and roads are not safe anymore, and getting resupplied with raw materials is more and more difficult. The enemy must have its own obscure, but efficient ways of extracting ore, as we've seen even orcs and other lowly beasts in their ranks go around covered with metal. Its quality matches that of the wearers: it is low-grade, cheap iron; the kind we would consider treacherous and not trust in normal times. But in these times our smelters learnt how to deal with poor materials too, if necessary. Every little bit helps.
; dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.6|A task, you say? The Master demands more troops every day, and they are never battle-worthy enough for Him... but armours don't just grow on skins, you know?^The maggots in charge of bringing ore supplies are treacherous and weak, they get themselves slaughtered too easily and we are left without materials. But these men, these elves... they always go around covered with shiny, precious metals protecting them as if they were all kings, down to their lowest-born...^Scavenge their corpses and bring me the metal, {playername}. With a pound of that iron, our smelter can make enough material to cover an entire pack of warriors.
; dlga_merchant_quest_brief:merchant_quest_brief_deliver_iron|We need {reg5} units of {s6} in {reg6} days, before our weaponsmiths run out of raw materials. What do you say?
; dlga_merchant_quest_brief_deliver_iron:merchant_quest_taken|Alright. I will get the metal scraps and bring them to you.
; dlga_merchant_quest_brief_deliver_iron:merchant_quest_stall|I am too busy to deal with that.
; dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.7|Thanks for offering to help. Actually I was looking for someone to escort a supply train. Perhaps you can do that...
; dlga_merchant_quest_brief:escort_merchant_caravan_quest_brief|I am going to send a supply train to {s8}. However with all those enemy patrols out there, I don't want to send them without an extra escort. A group at least {reg4} would offer them adequate protection.

; dlga_escort_merchant_caravan_quest_brief:merchant_quest_taken|Alright. I will escort the supply train.

; dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.8|Actually, I was looking for an able commander like you. There's this group of particularly troublesome goblins. They have infested the neighbourhood and are preying on supply trains and stray warriors. They have avoided all our patrols up to now.

; dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_deal_with_night_bandits|Do I indeed! There's a group of rogue goblins harassing the place, and I'm at the end of my rope as to how to deal with them.

They only attack lone people, never daring to show themselves when there's a group about. I need someone who can take on these goblins alone and win. That seems to be the only way of getting rid of them. Are you up to the task?
